# Rootless Pixel Launcher

I only made the launcher work on Pixel devices.

It's basically stock Pixel Launcher with custom icon pack support.
Works on any device running at least Lollipop.

The only thing that doesn't work is "At a Glance".
It'll only display the day of the week/month.
No weather or any additional features will be shown, as they are handled by the Google App, using package focused Intents that point to the stock Pixel Launcher package name.
